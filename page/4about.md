## 关于

#### 自我介绍

> The Android GitHub account provides a read-only mirror of some of the most common repositories from the Android Open Source Project. You can view the source code and review the history of the project, just like any other repository on GitHub. However, because this is a mirror, some things like contributing to the project work a little differently, which we'll talk about below.

没有可以介绍的,上面是Android GitHub的介绍
